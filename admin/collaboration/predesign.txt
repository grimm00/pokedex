Pokedex app: I want to create a pokedex as a part of a learning project to learn all of the things about the devlopment cycle, from backend to frontend
to ci/cd. I am a devops apprentice and wish to be able to speak intelligently about each part of this process.

I want to collaborate with you from the onset. I want to create a lot of organized documentation. admin/ will be a folder
where we will engage with one another, especially if I'm not in the chat itself and need to make longer prompts, while a docs
folder is where we will keep documents about our codebase as well as structured learning material/reflections.

A rule.txt folder will evolve overtime and be set of rules that should be kept in mind when going through this project.

First, I'm looking to get an idea of what we need to think about when it comes to making this pokedex, then we can 
agree on a roadmap for our project. Essentially, this is just brainstorming phase.
