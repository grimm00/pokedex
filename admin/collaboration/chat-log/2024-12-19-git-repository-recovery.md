# Git Repository Recovery Session
**Date:** December 19, 2024  
**Session Type:** Git Repository Corruption Recovery  
**Duration:** Ongoing  

## Issue Summary

### Problem Description
The git repository became corrupted with the following symptoms:
- `fatal: bad object HEAD`
- `object corrupt or missing`
- `fatal: bad object refs/heads/main`
- `fatal: bad object refs/remotes/origin/main`
- `fatal: bad object refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`

### Root Cause Analysis
The corruption likely occurred due to:
1. Interrupted git operations during development
2. File system issues or disk corruption
3. Concurrent git operations
4. Power loss or system crash during git writes

### Error Messages Encountered
```bash
fatal: bad object HEAD
fatal: bad object refs/heads/main
fatal: bad object refs/remotes/origin/main
fatal: bad object refs/remotes/origin/HEAD
error: object file .git/objects/XX/XXXXXXXXXXXXXX is empty
error: object file .git/objects/XX/XXXXXXXXXXXXXX is corrupt
```

## Recovery Process

### Step 1: Assessment
- Identified corrupted git objects in `.git/objects/` directory
- Confirmed repository was in an unusable state
- Verified that working directory files were intact

### Step 2: Backup Strategy
- Created backup of current working directory: `cp -r /home/grimm/pokedex /home/grimm/pokedex-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)`
- Ensured all current work was preserved before attempting recovery

### Step 3: Repository Reinitialization
- Removed corrupted `.git` directory: `rm -rf .git`
- Prepared to reinitialize git repository
- Plan to restore remote origin and commit history

### Next Steps (Planned)
1. Reinitialize git repository: `git init`
2. Add remote origin: `git remote add origin <repository-url>`
3. Add all current files: `git add .`
4. Create initial commit: `git commit -m "Recovery: Restore working frontend with modals"`
5. Push to remote: `git push -u origin main`

## Current Project State

### Working Features
- ✅ Frontend development environment (Vite + React + TypeScript)
- ✅ Pokemon card display with hover effects
- ✅ Pokemon detail modals with animations
- ✅ Type-specific color schemes for all 18 Pokemon types
- ✅ Responsive design and keyboard navigation
- ✅ Backend API (Flask) with Docker support

### Recent Achievements
- Successfully implemented Pokemon detail modals
- Fixed hover color effects for all Pokemon types
- Created comprehensive technical documentation
- Established working development workflow

### Files Preserved
All project files were successfully backed up including:
- Frontend source code (`frontend/src/`)
- Backend code (`backend/`)
- Documentation (`admin/`, `docs/`)
- Configuration files (`package.json`, `vite.config.ts`, etc.)
- Docker setup (`docker-compose.yml`)

## Lessons Learned

### Prevention Strategies
1. **Regular Commits**: Commit working states frequently
2. **Backup Strategy**: Maintain regular backups of working directory
3. **Git Best Practices**: Avoid interrupting git operations
4. **Repository Health**: Monitor git repository integrity

### Recovery Best Practices
1. **Always Backup First**: Never attempt recovery without backup
2. **Preserve Working Directory**: Focus on saving current work
3. **Document Process**: Record recovery steps for future reference
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify all functionality after recovery

## Technical Details

### Environment
- **OS:** Linux 6.6.87.2-microsoft-standard-WSL2
- **Shell:** /bin/bash
- **Working Directory:** /home/grimm/pokedex
- **Git Version:** (to be determined after reinitialization)

## Status
- **Current Phase:** Repository Recovery
- **Next Action:** Reinitialize git repository
- **Risk Level:** Low (all work backed up)
- **Estimated Recovery Time:** 15-30 minutes

## Notes
- All development work is preserved in backup
- No code or functionality was lost
- Recovery process is straightforward
- Project can continue development immediately after recovery

---

**Session Outcome:** Git repository corruption identified and recovery process initiated. All project work preserved through backup strategy. Ready to reinitialize repository and continue development.
