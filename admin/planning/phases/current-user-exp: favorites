My current experience as a user so far:

✅ FIXED: Favorite icon turns on and off, showing post and delete requests in the console.
✅ FIXED: "Favorite" options in the modal have been updated with working functionality.
✅ FIXED: Favorites now show in the Pokemon "Favorites" page for the logged-in user.
- They also don't show up in the dashboard (or at least some of them, but this isn't high priority)

Recent fixes:
- Updated toggleFavorite to refresh favorites after adding/removing
- Fixed PokemonModal to use actual favorites functionality instead of legacy placeholder
- Fixed removeFavorite to update favoritePokemon array
- Added proper error handling and loading states
- Fixed backend API to include full Pokemon data in favorites response
- Implemented comprehensive data validation system to prevent formatting issues

Data Validation System:
- Backend validation with detailed logging
- Frontend validation with TypeScript type checking
- Non-breaking validation that logs errors but doesn't break the app
- Comprehensive field and type checking for all API responses
- Created detailed validation guide for future maintenance
