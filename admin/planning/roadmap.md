## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Data Source Issues**: Implement fallback data sources
- **Performance Problems**: Regular performance testing
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Automated security scanning
- **Deployment Failures**: Blue-green deployment strategy

### Learning Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to MVP features initially
- **Technology Overwhelm**: Start simple, add complexity gradually
- **Time Management**: Use time-boxing for each phase
- **Documentation Debt**: Document as you go, not at the end
