### Docker and Containers
- **Images**: Immutable application packages
- **Containers**: Running instances of images
- **Registries**: Centralized image storage
- **Multi-stage Builds**: Optimized image creation
- **Orchestration**: Container management

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing and validation
- **Continuous Deployment**: Automated deployment to environments
- **Security Scanning**: Vulnerability assessment
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing and benchmarking
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and observability

## Quick Start

### Running GitHub Actions
```bash
# Trigger workflow manually
gh workflow run ci.yml

# View workflow status
gh run list

# View workflow logs
gh run view <run-id>
```

### Docker Operations
```bash
# Build images
docker-compose build

# Run services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop services
docker-compose down
```

### Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to staging
./scripts/deploy.sh staging

# Deploy to production
./scripts/deploy.sh production

# Health check
./scripts/health-check.sh

# Rollback
./scripts/rollback.sh production
```
