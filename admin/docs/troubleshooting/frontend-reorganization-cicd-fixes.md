# Frontend Reorganization CI/CD Troubleshooting Log

**Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Branch:** `chore/frontend-organization`  
**PR:** #7 - Frontend Organization: Restructure for Better Maintainability  
**Context:** Major frontend directory reorganization and CI/CD validation

---

## 🎯 **Overview**

This log documents the troubleshooting process for CI/CD failures encountered during the frontend reorganization project. The reorganization moved configuration files, Docker files, and consolidated directory structure, which required updates to various path references throughout the system.

## 📋 **Issue #1: Docker Build Failure - Missing Startup Script**

### **🚨 Problem Identified**
- **Failure Point:** CI/CD Build Job
- **Error Message:** `failed to calculate checksum of ref: "/scripts/docker-startup.sh": not found`
- **Root Cause:** Dockerfile referencing incorrect path for startup script

### **🔍 Investigation Process**
1. **Used GitHub CLI to identify failure:**
   ```bash
   gh pr checks 7
   # Result: build job failing, other tests passing
   ```

2. **Retrieved detailed logs:**
   ```bash
   gh run view 18227506199 --log-failed
   # Revealed: COPY scripts/docker-startup.sh /usr/local/bin/ failing
   ```

3. **Located actual file:**
   ```bash
   find scripts/ -name "*startup*" -o -name "*docker*"
   # Found: scripts/core/docker-startup.sh
   ```

### **✅ Solution Applied**
- **File Modified:** `Dockerfile` (line 120)
- **Change:** Updated path from `scripts/docker-startup.sh` to `scripts/core/docker-startup.sh`
- **Commit:** `d64c444` - "fix: update Dockerfile to use correct docker-startup.sh path"

### **📊 Impact**
- **Before:** Build job failing with exit code 1
- **After:** Build job should now pass (validation in progress)
- **Other Jobs:** No impact - unit, integration, performance, and docker-test jobs were already passing

### **🧠 Lessons Learned**
1. **Path Dependencies:** Directory reorganizations require careful tracking of all file references
2. **CI/CD Validation:** Essential for catching path mismatches that work locally but fail in clean environments
3. **GitHub CLI Efficiency:** `gh pr checks` and `gh run view --log-failed` provide rapid troubleshooting
4. **Systematic Investigation:** Start with high-level status, drill down to specific error messages

## 📋 **Issue #2: Docker Build Failure - Frontend Dist Path Mismatch**

### **🚨 Problem Identified**
- **Failure Point:** CI/CD Build Job (after Issue #1 fix)
- **Error Message:** `failed to calculate checksum of ref: "/app/frontend/dist": not found`
- **Root Cause:** Frontend build outputs to `../dist` but Dockerfile expects `/app/frontend/dist`

### **🔍 Investigation Process**
1. **Monitored CI/CD after Issue #1 fix:**
   ```bash
   gh pr checks 7
   # Result: build job still failing, but with different error
   ```

2. **Retrieved new failure logs:**
   ```bash
   gh run view 18227624796 --log-failed
   # Revealed: COPY --from=frontend-builder /app/frontend/dist ./frontend/dist failing
   ```

3. **Analyzed frontend build output:**
   - Frontend build shows: `../dist/index.html` (builds to parent directory)
   - Dockerfile expects: `/app/frontend/dist` (builds to current directory)
   - **Path Mismatch:** Our vite.config.ts change `outDir: '../dist'` conflicts with Dockerfile

### **✅ Solution Applied**
- **File Modified:** `frontend/config/vite.config.ts` (line 23)
- **Change:** Updated `outDir: '../dist'` back to `outDir: 'dist'` for Docker compatibility
- **Commit:** `[PENDING]` - "fix: correct frontend build output directory for Docker"

### **📊 Impact**
- **Before:** Frontend builds to `../dist`, Docker can't find `/app/frontend/dist`
- **After:** Frontend builds to `dist`, Docker can copy from `/app/frontend/dist`
- **Side Effects:** Local builds will now output to `frontend/dist` instead of project root

### **🧠 Lessons Learned**
1. **Multi-stage Docker Builds:** Changes to build output paths affect Docker COPY commands
2. **Configuration Conflicts:** Local development optimizations can break containerized builds
3. **Build Path Consistency:** Frontend build output must match Docker expectations
4. **Testing Scope:** Local testing doesn't catch Docker-specific path issues

## 🔄 **Current Status**

- **Issue #1:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - Docker startup script path corrected
- **Issue #2:** 🔧 **IN PROGRESS** - Frontend dist path mismatch identified, fix pending
- **Next Steps:** Apply Issue #2 fix and monitor CI/CD validation
- **Other Jobs:** Unit, integration, performance, and docker-test jobs all passing
