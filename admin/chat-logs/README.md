- **Find numbered logs**: Use chat-log-XXX.md format for sequential logs

- **Date-based**: `YYYY-MM-DD-description.md`
- **Numbered**: `chat-log-XXX.md`
- **Special**: `reflection-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

## Consolidation History

This directory was created by consolidating multiple scattered chat-log directories:
- `admin/chat-logs/` (recent logs)
- `admin/collaboration/chat-log/` (2024 logs)
- `admin/collaboration/chat-logs/` (numbered logs)

All chat logs are now organized in a single, consistent location.
