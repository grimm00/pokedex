# Pokedex Learning Project

A comprehensive Pokedex application designed as a learning project to master the full development cycle from backend to frontend to CI/CD, with a focus on DevOps practices.

## 🎯 Project Goals

This project serves as a hands-on learning experience for understanding:
- **Backend Development**: API design, database management, data modeling
- **Frontend Development**: Modern UI/UX, state management, responsive design
- **DevOps Practices**: CI/CD pipelines, containerization, monitoring, deployment
- **Full-Stack Integration**: End-to-end development workflow
- **Documentation**: Technical writing, API documentation, deployment guides
