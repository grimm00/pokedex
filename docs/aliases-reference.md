```bash
pokehub                    # Navigate to project
gf-status                  # Check current state
pokehub-backend            # Start backend (Terminal 1)
pokedex-frontend           # Start frontend (Terminal 2)
```

## ðŸ’¡ Tips

1. **New Terminal Sessions**: These aliases will be available in new terminal sessions after restarting your terminal or running `source ~/.zshrc`

2. **Current Session**: If aliases don't work in current session, restart your terminal or manually source: `source ~/.zshrc`

3. **Customization**: You can modify these aliases in your `~/.zshrc` file

4. **Git Flow**: Always use `gf-feature` and `gf-fix` instead of manual branch creation to maintain proper Git Flow

5. **Status Checking**: Use `gf-status` regularly to see your current Git Flow state

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

If aliases don't work:
```bash
# Reload your shell configuration
source ~/.zshrc

# Check if alias exists
alias gf-status

# Manually navigate and run if needed
cd /Users/cdwilson/Projects/pokedex
./scripts/git-flow-helper.sh status
```
